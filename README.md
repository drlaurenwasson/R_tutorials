# R_tutorials

Hi everyone,
Here is a repository of some R-tutorials that I have been sending out. Therefore, I decided to put them in one place for easy access.

This is R for beginners. I am a relative newbie at R so while some of this code could be shortened, these are vignettes designed for people who are not great at R but have data to analyzed.
